# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

In this repo I have used python to explore and get insights from data. 

In the Quant_Stats_1 file, we plot histograms, pie charts and box plots. We learn to identify categorical variables through an example. We also learn about the 5 number summary, i.e. min, Q1, median, Q3 and max and Standard Deviation of a distribution


In Descriptive_Stats part 1, we learn how to augment data to meaningful data types and to deal with missing values in the data. In part 2 we further explore our data using regression plots, box plots and heatmaps
